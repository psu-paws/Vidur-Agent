# GAIATrace & Vidur-Agent
Artifact for IISWC'26 **Characterizing How Complex Agentic AI Systems Handle General Tasks: A Trace-Based Simulation Study**

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.01725) | [Artifact (Zenodo)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.22133686)

The artifact is a two-stage pipeline. **GAIATrace** records what two real agent
systems did on the GAIA benchmark; **Vidur-Agent** replays those traces against a
simulated serving cluster.

```
GAIATrace/     stage 1 — agent runs  →  request-level traces   → GAIATrace/README.md
Vidur-Agent/   stage 2 — traces      →  simulation + figures   → Vidur-Agent/README.md
```

## The dependency between the two

Reproducing the paper runs them in order: Vidur-Agent replays the CSVs GAIATrace
produces. The coupling is loose — the traces are plain CSVs, and Vidur-Agent
needs only `num_prefill_tokens` and `num_decode_tokens` — so either side can be used with other inputs.

The run scripts look for the merged traces at these paths:

| produced by | file | consumed by |
|---|---|---|
| `GAIATrace/mirothinker/run_all.sh` | `GAIATrace/mirothinker/traces/miro_random.csv` | `run_miro.sh`, `run_miro70B.sh` |
| `GAIATrace/owl/run_all.sh` | `GAIATrace/owl/traces/owl_random.csv` | `run_owl.sh`, `run_owl70B.sh` |

The run scripts resolve these relative to `Vidur-Agent/`, so the two directories
must stay siblings as laid out above. If your traces live elsewhere, point at them
instead:

```sh
MIRO_TRACE=/path/to/miro_random.csv bash run_miro.sh
OWL_TRACE=/path/to/owl_random.csv   bash run_owl.sh
```

Each script checks its trace exists and stops with a message if not, rather than
failing later inside the simulator.


## Running end to end

```sh
# Stage 1 — generate traces (see GAIATrace/README.md for per-system detail)
cd GAIATrace/owl         && bash run_all.sh && cd ../..
cd GAIATrace/mirothinker && bash run_all.sh && cd ../..

# Stage 2 — simulate and plot (see Vidur-Agent/README.md)
cd Vidur-Agent
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate && uv sync
bash warmup_predictors.sh          # fit the execution-time predictors once
bash run_miro.sh && bash run_owl.sh && bash run_miro70B.sh && bash run_owl70B.sh
bash analysis/run_gantt_compare.sh
bash analysis/run_plot_ttft_tpot.sh
```

Stage 1 needs the agent systems and their model endpoints; stage 2 is CPU-only
and replays the recorded traces, so it can be run on its own once the CSVs exist.

## What each stage covers

**GAIATrace** records every LLM request two agent systems issued on GAIA —
prompt and output token IDs, inter-request dependencies, and measured tool
latency. OWL (multi-agent, 5,406 requests on GAIA-165-Val) and MiroThinker
(single agent plus summarizer, 2,082 requests on GAIA-103-Text).

**Vidur-Agent** extends [Vidur](https://github.com/microsoft/vidur) at commit
[`25e0082`](https://github.com/microsoft/vidur/commit/25e0082dbbfb206fb0477c3ebbededa7ead78949)
with heterogeneous replica groups, prefill–decode disaggregation with modelled KV
transfer, multi-turn sessions released by a dependency graph, and KV-aware
routing. It reproduces the paper's simulation results and figures.
